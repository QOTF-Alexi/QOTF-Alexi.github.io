        <h2>Why does this page exist?</h2>
	<p>
So as I said on my main page, I happen to be a trans person.
This page exists because I'd love to document the process behind it for myself and others to read (back).

        <h2>The beginnings.</h2>
	<p>
My egg started cracking somewhere in 2022, when someone yelled something at me that roughly translates to "Woah, you a fine young lady!"
I had feelings that I might not be what I seem from the outside for as long as I can remember, but always discarded them.
My "Covid cut" had gotten a bit out of hand and my hair had gotten pretty long, but from then on I decided to just keep it long, since I kind of enjoyed that interaction.
More "misgendering" happened over time and I grew more tolerant of "miss" while getting more intolerant for "mister".
Around this time I also started hating things about me. Most notably, my voice and the facial hair.
I felt like I had to act, but had no idea how, or where. I had a suspicion I had to go somewhere in the medical field, but how?
The last time I had been into contact with someone in a hospital was over 10 years ago and I don't think I've ever been into contact with my GP before.
So I set out to do my research. While doing my research, I did make a fresh Discord account to try my new identity on strangers.
It took me about half a year of researching (I like being as thorough as possible), before I found out where I had to go and what I had to do to get me there.
At that point, I just had to pick the right moment to start the action. My family is rather hostile, it seems, so I didn't want them to hear it.

	<h2>The phone call.</h2>
	<p>
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11th, 2023
So I dialed my general practitioner. On the first attempt, many people were waiting before me, so when it was almost my turn, the telephone exchange hung up on me.
Turns out it was the GP's lunch break. So I looked up the next call moment and I was the very first to ring them that time.
Going by others' experiences, I got lucky. Here's roughly how the call went:
Assistant: Hello, this is x from GP y's office.
Me: Hi this is (deadname). I would like a referral letter.
Assistant: Okay, what's the reason and where would you like to be referred to?
Me: I think I'm suffering from gender dysphoria and I would like to be referred to (practice).
Assistant: Alright. Do note the actual GP might want to talk with you about this. We'll call you back either way.
	</p>
	<p>
And that was the end of the call. A few hours later, I got a call.
	</p>
	<p>
Assistant: Hi your referral letter is ready to be picked up. We failed to submit it to the practice directly, so you'll have to mail it yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
So I went to pick up the letter and send it out. This was fairly uneventful.
However it did take about a month for the practice to get back to me. In that time I thought the post had lost it, but they did eventually receive it.
	</p>
	<p>
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25th, 2023
My phone rang. They received my letter and they just needed my e-mail address for a questionnaire. I was SHAKING of excitement. Finally someone might be willing to listen to me.
So I filled out the questionnaire and returned it. And with that I got put on a 30-week waitlist.
	</p>
	<p>
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13th, 2023
A phone call? That was soon! The practice found some room in the schedule. So I have an appointment for December 21st of 2023!
Just had to fill out some more forms and accept the terms. I did nearly fall off my chair when I saw the prices...
	</p>

  	<div id="intake"></div>
	<!-- The intake -->
	<div></div>
	<h2>The intake.</h2>
	<p>
The intake was fairly uneventful.
We went over a few things, such as when the feelings started, the family situation, HRT and other treatments such as surgery and a load of private things I do not wish to publish to the internet.
The person I spoke to is going to set up a report for other people I will be speaking to in the future, as well as change the location I would need to go to.
For this intake, I had to travel 3 hours, one way. This could have been much shorter, given the appointment was only half an hour long…
But at least I got to see a bit of the country that I had never seen before.
	</p>
	<p>
As I’m writing this, a group of loud high school students are yelling through the ANC of my headphones…
This really makes you appreciate the silent section of trains. Anyways, I’m getting off topic.
So everything has been discussed and ideas have been formed. Now on to waiting for the treatment part to commence, but I doubt I will be waiting very long.

And now I’m done writing this part, I will go stare out of the window again. I’m excited to see Rotterdam again.
I don’t look forward to inhaling the terrible air though… Maybe I should move outside of the Randstad area whenever I can.

	<h2>The phone call part 2 (and something else).</h2>
	<p>
Got a call while I was at school. Again sooner than expected (30 weeks became 7 weeks, I think).
I now have an appointment for the first consult after intake on February 8th of 2024, again on a Thursday.
I did inform my study career coach about the appointment again, however this time I also mentioned that I am more than willing to explain these appointments if he's interested.
In other words, I guess I will be coming out to him sooner than to my parents... But school seems to be the safer environment for that anyways...
	</p>

	<div id="consult1"></div>
	<!-- The first consult -->
	<div></div>
	<h2>The first consult.</h2>
	<p>
The first consult was similar to the intake. We went over a lot of introductory stuff and I got some homework: writing a life story.
I have never done this before so I had no idea how to do this and my writing skills are quite rusty. I will probably end up with 20 versions to pick from, but we'll see.
One thing that was different, is the location. Now I only had to travel for a little over an hour. This is much more manageable, especially since I need to go there every two weeks now.
I do hope this won't be too much of an issue with my parents, since I will need to come up with excuses for that... I'm leaning towards saying I have meetings for my group project in school.
	</p>

	<div id="consult2"></div>
	<!-- The second consult -->
	<div></div>
	<h2>The second consult.</h2>
	<p>
We went over my plan of treatment and any changes that needed to be made to it.
Basically it includes what my struggles and questions are as well as what I want (such as HRT, speech training, operations etc).
I also had to add a person to contact in emergencies. I hope that will never need to be used… After all the changes were made, I gave my thumbs up.
Next I had to tell my life story. It seemed a bit superficial but I was allowed to add any stuff that popped into mind and thanks to that I managed to make it a bit less superficial.
My dad got picked out of it and I was asked some stuff about him and mainly the relationship with him.
Then the question was asked “do you feel he loves you?”. I instantly answered yes, but for some reason my stupid head had to add “I think” to it.
Turns out I say “I think” a lot because they suggested a “I think” jar, like a swear jar.
From this I learnt I think too much where I should be feeling things. Not even two sentences later, the “I think” bomb dropped again.
I have decided that I am going to buy an “I think” jar, or keep count and make a digital “I think” jar and throw in a Euro every time I append this to my sentences.
I'm being serious here, I append way too many questioning things to my sentences. Not only “I think”, but also “I guess” or “probably”. This is something I must work on.
I got more tips though. One suggestion was to wear my hair differently. Currently I’m hiding behind it because I’m kind of afraid of others and their opinions.
Another was to get the pretty girlygirl to show a little more with the help of clothing and accessories. I will definitely be experimenting with that as much as I possibly can.
Closing off, I met a parent of a trans person in the same municipality as me. Good to know I’m not the only one there.

	<div id="consult3"></div>
	<!-- The third consult -->
	<div></div>
	<h2>The third consult: "graph your feelings".</h2>
	<p>
We started off with a few questions about my expssion (eg my earrings and how I had my hair in a ponytail).
Based on what I said, they reassured me that it’s fine to be vulnerable with them, but also around others.
I guess it is kind of scary showing myself while I’m used to having a cloak to hide under.
	</p>
	<p>
Next I was asked to move seats so I could see the genderbread cookie one of the psychologists had drawn on the board.
I got a bit of an explanation about this thing and you probably need that too.
So it’s basically a graphic that shows where various aspects are, how you feel about these and where you want to see yourself.
They include gender identity, gender expression, biological gender, sexual attraction and romantic attraction.
So we filled it out. While I thought I wasn’t completely sure about my feelings, it became crystal clear when it was all there on the whiteboard.
I nearly broke out in tears once I saw how far apart my current view and preferences are. But it was correct and I am sure about that.
The only part that I have some doubt about is my sexual attraction. Based on this graphic, we decided we’ll be working on gender expression first.
I think that will be the best starting point because that’s been the most difficult for me. I’m not entirely sure how we’ll be working on it but we’ll see soon enough.
One might ask, why not start with the biological part first? Well I’m in a trajectory and that will be the end goal while we slowly work towards fully discovering and transitioning me without medical stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
Oh and the “I think” counter went up to 3, which isn’t terrible.
