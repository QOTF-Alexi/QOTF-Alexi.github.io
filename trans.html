        <h2>Why does this page exist?</h2>
	<pre>
So as I said on my main page, I happen to be a trans person.
This page exists because I'd love to document the process behind it for myself and others to read (back).

        <h2>The Beginnings.</h2>
	<pre>
My egg started cracking somewhere in 2022, when someone yelled something at me that roughly translates to "Woah, you a fine young lady!"
I had feelings that I might not be what I seem from the outside for as long as I can remember, but always discarded them.
My "Covid cut" had gotten a bit out of hand and my hair had gotten pretty long, but from then on I decided to just keep it long, since I kind of enjoyed that interaction.
More "misgendering" happened over time and I grew more tolerant of "miss" while getting more intolerant for "mister".
Around this time I also started hating things about me. Most notably, my voice and the facial hair.
I felt like I had to act, but had no idea how, or where. I had a suspicion I had to go somewhere in the medical field, but how?
The last time I had been into contact with someone in a hospital was over 10 years ago and I don't think I've ever been into contact with my GP before.
So I set out to do my research. While doing my research, I did make a fresh Discord account to try my new identity on strangers.
It took me about half a year of researching (I like being as thorough as possible), before I found out where I had to go and what I had to do to get me there.
At that point, I just had to pick the right moment to start the action. My family is rather hostile, it seems, so I didn't want them to hear it.

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 11th, 2023
So I dialed my general practitioner. On the first attempt, many people were waiting before me, so when it was almost my turn, the telephone exchange hung up on me.
Turns out it was the GP's lunch break. So I looked up the next call moment and I was the very first to ring them that time.
Going by others' experiences, I got lucky. Here's roughly how the call went:
Assistant: Hello, this is x from GP y's office.
Me: Hi this is (deadname). I would like a referral letter.
Assistant: Okay, what's the reason and where would you like to be referred to?
Me: I think I'm suffering from gender dysphoria and I would like to be referred to (practice).
Assistant: Alright. Do note the actual GP might want to talk with you about this. We'll call you back either way.

And that was the end of the call. A few hours later, I got a call.

Assistant: Hi your referral letter is ready to be picked up. We failed to submit it to the practice directly, so you'll have to mail it yourself.

So I went to pick up the letter and send it out. This was fairly uneventful.
However it did take about a month for the practice to get back to me. In that time I thought the post had lost it, but they did eventually receive it.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 25th, 2023
My phone rang. They received my letter and they just needed my e-mail address for a questionnaire. I was SHAKING of excitement. Finally someone might be willing to listen to me.
So I filled out the questionnaire and returned it. And with that I got put on a 30-week waitlist.

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 13th, 2023
A phone call? That was soon! The practice found some room in the schedule. So I have an appointment for December 21st of 2023!
Just had to fill out some more forms and accept the terms. I did nearly fall off my chair when I saw the prices...

  	<div id="intake"></div>
	<!-- The Intake -->
	<div></div>
	<h2>The Intake.</h2>
	<pre>
The intake was fairly uneventful.
We went over a few things, such as when the feelings started, the family situation, HRT and other treatments such as surgery and a load of private things I do not wish to publish to the internet.
The person I spoke to is going to set up a report for other people I will be speaking to in the future, as well as change the location I would need to go to.
For this intake, I had to travel 3 hours, one way. This could have been much shorter, given the appointment was only half an hour long…
But at least I got to see a bit of the country that I had never seen before.

As I’m writing this, a group of loud high school students are yelling through the ANC of my headphones…
This really makes you appreciate the silent section of trains. Anyways, I’m getting off topic.
So everything has been discussed and ideas have been formed. Now on to waiting for the treatment part to commence, but I doubt I will be waiting very long.

And now I’m done writing this part, I will go stare out of the window again. I’m excited to see Rotterdam again.
I don’t look forward to inhaling the terrible air though… Maybe I should move outside of the Randstad area whenever I can.

	<h2>The Phone Call part 2 (and something else).</h2>
	<pre>
Got a call while I was at school. Again sooner than expected (30 weeks became 7 weeks, I think).
I now have an appointment for the first consult after intake on February 8th of 2024, again on a Thursday.
I did inform my study career coach about the appointment again, however this time I also mentioned that I am more than willing to explain these appointments if he's interested.
In other words, I guess I will be coming out to him sooner than to my parents... But school seems to be the safer environment for that anyways...
