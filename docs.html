	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p>
This is a page where I will be documenting random things.
I haven't considered what exactly, so this is going to be interesting for both of us.
I might put random ideas, thoughts or information here.

	<h2>OS/2 Madness</h2>
	<p>
I have a completely custom-built computer (yes, that includes the case), which has a 386. This hardware is basically unusable, even in retro terms.
It can barely run Windows 95 and most DOS games will not run thanks to the abysmal Trident video adapter. But it does give us the opportunity to peek at how things used to be for general computing stuff.
That's why I decided to install a super irrelevant OS, namely OS/2 Warp. Specifically version 3, because it's the last that can run on a 386.
<br>
Sadly, I only have absolutely huge hard drives, so getting through the setup was a nightmare. The hard drive needs to be under 1GB in size.
Next, the largest "installable" partition size is 503 MB. This only seems to work for FAT and not for the version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Performance_File_System">HPFS</a> OS/2 Warp 3 ships with.
While trying to find the largest partition HPFS supports, I got lazy and ended up creating a 300MB FAT partition, leaving about 500MB of unallocated space on my disk.
I suppose I can find the largest HPFS partition later, once the entire OS is installed and running.
<br>
At the end of the first part of the setup, they ask you to remove the floppy from the drive, but you must also remove the CD. Otherwise, the 2nd part of the installation will freeze.
It will eventually throw an error about drive D: not being ready, which is the time to re-insert the CD. It seems like the entire system, with all optional components fits on 35 MB of space.
<br>
All set up now, and it's a tad slow. I suspect that might be due to the 4MB of RAM I have available, as the CPU seems to be doing nothing.
The specs of this machine barely meet <a href="https://www.os2world.com/wiki/index.php/IBM_OS/2_Warp_3#Key_Prerequisites">the minimum requirements for OS/2 Warp 3</a>. At least there's a math coprocessor in the Am386DX-40...
<br>
It seems like I'm going to have to find some more RAM for this thing, so it's at least a little more usable. I'll mess around with it some more whenever though.
<br><br>
Also, I am so sorry for the very AI-esque title, it's the best I can come up with...

	<h2>Squeezebox Cleaning</h2>
	<p>
Seems like there's gonna be a lot of tech, ey? Anyway, here is a quick infodump about the Squeezebox Duet Controller.
<br>
I recently acquired a Squeezebox Duet (which consists of a controller and a receiver), thanks to a video from F4mi on YouTube.
Sadly, the scrollwheel of the controller would get stuck sometimes, so I decided to give it a clean. From what I can tell, you don't have to disassemble the controller to remove the scrollwheel.
I did that anyway, which is not advisable as the screw posts are rather fragile and the display will be bare for a while.
The scrollwheel is friction fit onto the motherboard and has a tiny part inside for the centre button. This will either come flying out, or stay inside the controller.
This litte bit goes in with the nub facing up. Anyways, all I did was thoroughly clean the insides of the scrollwheel, added some graphite pencil to the graphite pads (they were quite faded) and applied a little dab of Magnalube. 
After all that, it now works like new again!
<br>
y no pix? Cuz I forgot to take them, soz. If you have any, make an issue on <a href="https://github.com/QOTF-Alexi/QOTF-Alexi.github.io">the GitHub repo</a> of this page and I'll add them in!
