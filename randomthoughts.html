    <h2>A look back at 2025</h2>
    <h3>December 17th, 2025</h3>
    <p>
        This year, a lot of things happened. Positive, as well as negative. Let's have a look!<br>
        I got into trainspotting. While I always liked trains, I now decided it would be a good moment to take photos of
        them.
        My first spot was on August 17th, I think. It was a picture of ICMm 4080 sporting some graffiti art that I
        really liked. Not just a tag, but actually a nice artwork that respected the livery of the train really well.
        <img src="assets/2025/firstspot.jpg" alt="An ICM train with graffiti"
             style="float:right;width:33%;height:auto;margin-right:1%;">
        I also started keeping track of all the trains I rode. At the time of writing, I have done 6396km in 3 days and
        55
        minutes, with a total delay of 2 hours and 37 minutes. ICM was on top, with 23 rides and 1565km.
        I had the most rides on R-Net FLIRT-TAG number 2015 (4 times), made the most distance in NS ICNG 3146 (with
        208km), and I
        travelled the most on 8 December, with 551km.<br>
        In the community of public transport workers and fans, I made several new friends (yes, Krist, you are one of
        them).
        I've even done spotting and just travelling for fun with a few people and I really enjoyed doing that.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sadly, I still do not enjoy my education (computer programming) in any way, but I intend to find something I
        like some time in the new year.
        I have to redo year 2, and sadly I keep getting blamed for using AI while I don't (I'm writing this text right
        here, would you think I'm too lazy to write functional and clean code?).
        It's very demotivating, but I try to pull through.
    </p>
    <p>
        I fell in love for the first time. I didn't know it was possible. Sadly, it didn't go the way I had hoped.
        I fell in love for the second time. We got into a relationship, and then I got dumped, three months later.
        Eventually, I found out what a huge bullet I had dodged. But the people I got back in return are all worth
        it.<br>
        My mental health is still not where it should be, but I'm slowly crawling back up again.
        Sadly coming out as trans to my parents made it worse, but thankfully, there are other people who do accept me
        for who I am.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sooo, this year had its ups and downs. What am I going to do next year?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I am going to try to meet up with more (online) friends more often. It's fun to hang out with people.</li>
        <li>I am going to find work or education that I do enjoy and doesn't try to eat me.</li>
        <li>I am going to find more fun stuff to do. I feel like I don't do fun things often enough.</li>
        <li>I am going to spend less money on stuff I don't need. I need a house, not another laptop.</li>
        <li>I am going to rely less on big companies and more on local stores, small businesses, or hobbyists.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These lists tend to be forgotten, and I have to be realistic. I should work on one thing at a time.
        If I "fail" on one or more, I shouldn't let that drag me down. Let's take baby steps towards happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, I would like to wish everyone a very merry Christmas and a wonderful new year!
