        <h2>Information about me.</h2>
	<pre>
I'm from the Rotterdam area (That's in the Netherlands) and I was born in March of 2005.
I forget stuff often. You might want to call me <q>Queen of the Forgetsies</q>.

Currently a software engineering student after one failed year of electrical engineering.
EE on uni level incorporates a lot of math and I sucked at that specific math.

I like photography, touching grass and working on retro tech (mainly audio equipment).
I'm looking for some fixer upper projects to undertake.

I'm MtF transgender and I use she/her pronouns. May or may not be ace (I enjoy garlic bread).
I am not on HRT, I am considering it but I'm honestly too afraid of people. Closeted irl since October 11, 2022.
Now we have that out the way, I can delete my pronouns.page and people won't have to ask about it.
