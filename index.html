        <h2>Information about me.</h2>
	<pre>
I'm from the Rotterdam area (That's in the Netherlands) and I was born in March of 2005.
I forget stuff often. You might want to call me <q>Queen of the Forgetsies</q>.

Currently a software engineering student after one failed year of electrical engineering.
Weird route to take? Maybe, but it was the first alternative that came to mind.
EE on uni level incorporates a lot of math and I sucked at that specific math.
That does not stop me from screwing around with electronics, though. I love building up random things!
Also I am confident that one day, I will be doing something related to electrical engineering.

I like photography, touching grass and working on retro tech (mainly audio equipment).
I'm looking for some fixer upper projects to undertake.

I'm MtF transgender and I use she/her pronouns. May or may not be ace (I enjoy garlic bread).
Waiting on the diagnosis since September 18, 2023. Closeted irl since October 11, 2022.
Now we have that out the way, I can delete my pronouns.page and people won't have to ask about it.

        <h2>The PC.</h2>
	<pre>
Here's a story about a PC. Some time ago, someone was offering a PC case with some leftover components inside for free.
I'm Dutch so free is my favourite word of course. I picked the thing up, threw a cooler, some RAM, a GPU , storage and a sketchy power supply at it and called it "The Free PC".
Most important specs at that time:
	Intel Core i3-4130 with a 360mm AIO watercooler, 10GB RAM (3x2 + 1x4), a GT 730 and a 160GB SSD. The 350W Deer PSU "worked" but was pretty questionable.
	It resided inside a Silverstone case that was honestly terrible to work in.
Shortly after, I ordered a case. A Deepcool Matrexx 55 Mesh. I forgot a power supply, though I knew the Deer's cables were too short.
So the next day, I also ordered a Be Quiet! System Power 10 450W. Throwing this all together got me a relatively underpowered but pretty PC.
Then I noticed a graphics card for sale locally. A Gigabyte branded GTX 980 Ti. Bought it instantly. Minor regrets but it's a capable card still.
The CPU bottleneck was awful! So I went looking through used processors and found an Intel Core i5-4590 for cheap. Bought it and threw it in.
The last upgrade it has gotten is the 2TB Samsung 870 Evo. I could have gotten an upgrade kit and some NVMe storage, but this will do.

So The Not-so-free PC got a few upgrades and it's now a relatively capable system. I like it a lot and I use it a lot as well.
Current specs (complete):
	An ASRock B85M Pro4 with Intel Core i5-4590 with a 360mm watercooler, 10GB RAM (3x2 + 1x4), a GTX 980 Ti, a 160GB Intel SSD and a 2TB Samsung 870 Evo.
	Powered with a Be Quiet! System Power 10 450W, inside a Deepcool Matrexx 55 Mesh with 3 Arctic P12 PWM PST fans. Windows 11 Pro for OS.
<b>Notice on the PSU: it might seem on the weak side, but has never shut off or crashed the system during intense loads.
GPU pulls 255W normally and the CPU goes up to 85W, which leaves enough room for the other components. Though it probably is at its ceiling.</b>

	<h2>Where To Find Me.</h2>
	<pre>
You can find me in a few places on the internet.
For the most part, you will have to look yourself, but here's a few.
	</pre>
	<h3>Discord</h3>
	<pre>
Yes, I am on Discord. My username is <b>qotf_alexi</b>
You cannot friend request me, so try to find me in servers. I am in a few public ones.
There is also a throwaway alt account under a different name but I'd probably expect you to find my main way before that.
	</pre>
	<h3>Github</h3>
	<pre>
My username for Github is <b>QOTF-Alexi</b>.
